Upon seperation from the doundation a foundation person will make effort in good faith to transfer administrative rights or ownership to an active foundation associated person for operational accounts created while serving in the capacity of a foundation association person, and for operational accounts which the foundation has reimbursed the foundation person for during which that person was a foundation person.

In the case of incapacity due to death or disability the foundation person gives the foundation the right to represent them for this purpose and execute this agrement for transfer of administrive or ownership rights on his or her behalf.

For example, if an accountant working in the capacity of a foundation associated person uses an online accounting software as a service to generate and file year end statements, and the accountant seperates from the foundation, then the obligation would be to provide access to foundation data, but not to the accounts for the online accounting software unless the account for the online accounting software was explicity created only for the foundation and not as part of a service that the accountant was providing to the foundation.
